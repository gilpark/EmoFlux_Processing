# EmoFlux_Processing
EmoFlux is a system that visualizes the emotional flow as a weather pattern. It allows the audience to see the emotional circulation and distribution across the country and the neighborhoods that they live in. Through this project, I discover and explore the relationships between the geographical space and emotions that are shared via Twitter. I delve into this concept from two angles: firstly, how peopleâ€™s emotions are related to their neighborhoods? secondly, how the infra structure affects people sharing their emotions through SNS (specifically twitter).
